            <div class="description-content">
                <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly challenging the traditional notions of art: how it is created, felt, and recognized. What was once only accessible to those professionally trained had now evolved into something laymen can generate in mere seconds. While this may indicate better accessibility to the field, it has its threats and complications that destabilises the long-standing cultures, values, and power structures within the art world.</p>
                <p>This syllabus explores these tensions through looking back into the history of AI in art, from basic algorithms that result in line arts to complex neural networks that produce a unique artistic style. It introduces the present state of generative AI, tracking the remarkable transformation of creativity brought about by advances in computer, data, and machine learning. Aside from the technical aspect of AI in art, this syllabus also examines the philosophical and psychological conflict regarding why humans accept or reject AI art.</p>
                <p>Delving into the emotional aspect between art and humans, this syllabus discusses how machines try to imitate feelings, how audiences project emotion onto synthetic outputs, and how we understand human feelings through these interactions. The last module explores the future of AI in the art world on how we can capitalize on this powerful tool instead of creating competition and by recognizing the blurred boundaries between creator, tool, and collaborator.</p>
                <p>This syllabus challenges the consideration of AI's growing involvement in art from a critical, artistic, and ethical standpoint. It also asks them to consider what new kinds of expression, connection, and controversy could mark a new era of creative practice.</p>

                    <div class="module-description">
                        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has quickly taken over the modern century. From once being a science fiction, it now animates the tools we use to speak, create, navigate, and imagine. AI systems have found its way into society through our music recommendations,  movements across city streets and increasingly create the text, images, and sounds that make up our digital environments. In a matter of years, machine learning models have evolved from specialized research tools to mass-market creative partners integrated into homes, workplaces, classrooms, and social media.</p>
                        <p>Long before the upcoming of this global phenomenon, artists have been figuring out the other side of this technical machine from how it thinks, sees, or makes an image on its own. Understanding the history of AI in art reveals that today’s explosion of generative tools is not an isolated event but part of a much longer continuum of experimentation, critique, and imagination. From early algorithmic experiments and cybernetic aesthetics to the rise of machine learning art and the current generative AI culture, this module examines the evolution of artificial intelligence in art throughout history.</p>
                        <h3>I. Prehistories of AI Art: Early AI, Machines, and Algorithms</h3>

                        <br>
                        <p>AI art already began before AI. Even way back in the ancient period, the idea of creating a life-like being began to sprout (Iacob, 2024). This idea resulted into machine contraptions such as automatons that are machines that follow a sequence of operations to create an illusion that they are self-operated. Wolfgang Von Kemplen presented the Mechanical Turk way back in the 18th century where it differed from the existing automatons as it displayed human-like intelligence, being able to play chess with any human opponent (Patowary, 2022). The secret behind this magnificent machine was actually a human operator creating the illusion of the Turk being to play chess like a human. </p>
                        <p>Interestingly enough, the Mechanical Turk serves as a mirror of AI in our own age: foreshadowing today’s invisible human workers in dataset labeling and content moderation.</p>

                        <p>As computers evolve, so does the scale of artistic collaboration between humans and machines. Basic algorithms became neural networks, which opened up new possibilities. From being an artistic tool, AI slowly became artistic partners that can create art in a unique method with the guidance of human input. Artists “trained” these machines through repetition, examples, and imagination.</p>

                        <p>From basic algorithms, to artistic tools, to artistic partners, and finally into its final form in the 21st century. AI has attained the ability to generate images, videos, and sounds that not only imitate but complicate human creativity with just the use of possible reference material and language prompts. In the current society, AI art is more than just a genre; it's a cultural movement that has resulted in anything from gigantic data centers and community-made fan art to popular TikTok filters and billion-peso auctions, and our personal phone apps.</p>
                        <p>Complex systems such as Generative Adversarial Network (GANs) and Diffusion models brought a new aesthetic signature to AI art by depicting fragmentation, surreal continuity, fluid morphing, dataset ghosts, and speculative realism. One great example is Refik Anadol’s “Machine Hallucinations” where he made use of millions of images of flowers, trees, mushrooms,  landscapes, water clouds, etc. as datasets to train the model (Refik Anadol Studio, 2024).</p>

                        <p>In 2018, AI art had one of its biggest auction sales with the artwork “Portrait of Edmond Belamy”. It was sold for $432,500, marking the debut of AI art on the global auction scene. (Benney & Kistler, n.d.). This rise for recognition of AI art raised some key questions like “who is the owner of outputs of a generative model? Is it the artist? The coder? The dataset creator? Or the collective?”.</p>

                        <p>Looking at the state of AI art in the present time, it has become less of a museum piece and more of daily consumption art. We see and use them in different social media platforms through filters, videos, captions, and other community involvements. As a result, a new kind of "visual citizenship" is created, allowing for the democratization of production of art and dismantling traditional artistic gatekeeping (Herrie et al., 2024).</p>
                        <p>The rise of AI in art opened up new avenues for creativity along with challenges that threaten the creative space. As Baxter (2024) said in her article, the future of art should not be a competition between humans and machines, but a partnership that we need to cultivate and build upon carefully. What emerges from this tension may become the next major artistic movement.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>This module investigates the central controversy defining the AI era: Does the use of algorithmic tools constitute "cheating," or is it a natural evolution of artistic practice? Drawing on the concept of Mimesis (imitation), this unit challenges students to define where the "human" ends and the "machine" begins.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>We will examine the "Imitation Spectrum" described in social cognitive neuroscience, exploring why humans socially reject "over-imitation" (the Uncanny Valley) and how this bias shapes our rejection of AI art. We will contrast this with the "Intentionalist" view of art, which argues that value comes from human agency and the "Gift Economy" (Lewis Hyde)—the idea that art is a social bond, not just a commodity.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>To contextualize modern fears, we will look backward. We will analyze the historical controversy surrounding the Camera Obscura and the Daguerreotype. Just as critics in the 16th and 19th centuries accused Vermeer and photographers of "copying nature" rather than creating art, we will ask if Prompt Engineering is merely the modern version of tracing a projected image.</p>

                        <p>Students will be shown a series of 10 artworks (Mix of Abstract, Impressionist, and Photorealist). Half will be human-made, half AI-generated. Students must vote on the origin of each. Afterward, we will discuss the results in the context of the Gangadharbatla (2022) study, which suggests humans are statistically unable to distinguish the two, proving our bias is often conceptual rather than aesthetic.</p>

                    <div class="module-description">
                        <p>Art is often defined as a skillful appeal to one’s aesthetics, using techniques to paint thought-provoking images, sculpture, and even performances. It is an activity where artists make use of their lived experiences and personal beliefs to express — and even evoke — ideas and emotions unto others (Freeman, 2014). Throughout history, it has been used for historical documentation and peaceful protests, even being found through national heroes such as Jose Rizal — in the form of his Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo.</p>
                        <p>Contrary to common belief, art does not have to be grand; in fact, even simple doodles done during class could be considered as such. So long as it conveys the artist’s intentions to the audience, it cannot be dismissed simply for “lacking technique”.</p>

                        <p>Through developing technology, modern-day artists are now presented with a convenient way to take part in such activity: generative AI. The use of such allows one to quickly create images, however, controversies regarding its “soulless” look quickly swept through online discussions — being described as “uncanny,” or “lacking in emotions.” For this reason, AI art is described as being “unable to evoke any sort of emotions due to its lack of human nature.”</p>
                        <p>Conversely, AI art has been shown to still possess the ability to do so. The perceived lack of “emotional resonance” was simply a product of biases and prejudice against AI art. According to Agudo (2022), evoked emotions were found to be watered down by knowledge of AI use, fueled by antagonistic disposition against generative art.</p>

                        <p>Students will participate in a moderated roundtable discussion / debate. Students will be placed in groups of four and will be prompted to discuss potentially contentious issues stemming from the assigned readings. After a set time within the same session, the students will informally debate other groups, having been assigned to certain sides.</p>
                        <p>Students will then submit a short reflection on their past contentions by highlighting points from both the affirmative and negative sides and providing their own personal commentary and judgment. This is to be done asynchronously.</p>
